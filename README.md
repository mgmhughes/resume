# Morrigan Hughes Resume and Cover Letter Sample

The files included in this repository are samples of my resume and cover letter created in `R` using `R Markdown` and `LaTeX` syntax. The basis for `preamble_resume.tex` and `preamble_coverletter.tex` is the MPS Theme package I created which can be found at https://github.com/mpsofda/mpstheme. Both the resume and cover letter load the environment `contact.RData` [which has not been included in this repository] to include my contact information by calling variables created for that environment.
